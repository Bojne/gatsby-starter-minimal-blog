### Why Project Ideas (in public)?

*Why build projects*
I think building project is _luxery way of learning_. Firstly, instead of input knowledge to your brain single way, you export knowledge and interact with it from a deeper level. Secondly, you connect the knowledge with visable application, which means you will also consider about prodcut, UX, and roadmap. That means skills you learned is more likely to be apply in your work (or more ambicious projects). Yet, building project takes more time than merely crash-course of those knowledge, and you might not acutally get those benefit if you didn't finish them. 

So this is why I think learning by building project is an ideal and luxery way of learning.


Here's a list of my project ideas. 

1. More friendly clock to show the time difference [Link]() (#WIP)

2. Personal website 2.O ([Current](bojne.github.io))

3. Data visuazlization related (Brainstorming)
