Hi there! 

This is officially my first blog post. 

I just build the site today with [Netlify]("https://netlify.com") and done a bit of editing. 

Oh, by the way, Netlify is also where I'm going to work this summer! I'm a upcoming data science interns and really excited to learn & contribute to the team.

This excitement transformed into motivation of learning. Today I found some cool stuff, such as:

  1. [Airbnb Data Science Blog]("https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering") - a lot of case study 

  2. [Kaggle Learning]("https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview") - with courses for basic DS skills.  
  
  3. [Data Science Lessons from Young Tsai]("https://medium.com/young-tsai/tagged/data") - Young was my mentor at Jun-Yi, he shares a lot of his thoughts in this blog. 

Therefore, I made this [Notion page]("https://www.notion.so/yhhuang/f115100b075840f9bf971dcb70fd8f73?v=aac4c630813a465395235ef0d8a70201") aim to collect and process my Data Science readings. Let's see how it goes!

Yet, the best thing I found today is this: [Interview podcast with Mathias, CEO of Netlify]("https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/03/08/netlify-with-mathias-biilmann-christensen/") on SE Daily. The host asked so many good questions, that I just want to highlight some of them here:

1. How would you describe Netlify?
2. As front-end engineer, people often feels the need of learning everything. What's your thoughts on that?
3. Does being a CEO changed your view about business?
4. How do you decide area of focus, if the trend itself is complex and overwhamled?
5. What distinguish Netlify from other Platform-As-A-Service company(such as Firebase)? 
6. What makes you choose to become a tech CEO rather than musician? (The CEO earned a music degree in college!)
7. What has been the biggest challenge to Netlify?

Got really interesting answers:
- Working in Netlify is building tool for people, so people can create amazing things. For example, running the JAMstack hackathon enables beginners to build great projects with Netlify, and it's so rewarding to see that. 
- Netlify has 10,000,000 monthly unique user per month (wow!)
- Being a tech CEO v.s. music composer: Something in two roles are surprisingly common, such as letting a group of people follow the same motion, building the vision for the team, make people believe in the same thing. The great path is not taking micro-management, but lead the poeple to do amazing work. 
- The process of testing -> learning -> iterating -> product market fit is _enjoyable_ !
- The trends that makes Netlify high potential: (1) Git & Version control become popular. (2) The evoluation of broswer: From document viewing to operating system that process JS code. (3) The rise of microservices, make the job more focus on connecting services together.   
- "Product is not a company.", the CEO has to understand how to 

Glad to find this podcast and finish it today! A great inspiration and learning. Actually, there're so many terms that I don't know the theory behind. Hopefully, all this curiosity will be learning motivation, and I'm looking forward to upcoming learning journey! 

p.s. Spent quite chill time and UC Berkeley today.
