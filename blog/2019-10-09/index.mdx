### Svitlana 💐

Good vibe! Morning routine, mountain, city exploration in different context. 

Assignment could be hard to me, but it is not just me feel so. Still need to work thought. 

Spending time with friends. 

Reminder: Climbing together.

### Leon 👨🏻‍🍳

"But Yueh Han, you know, we can cook together sometime in the reshall!" - Leon. 

That was warm. Especially after SS110. 

What I actually feel: 

Flywheel of academics. Not efficient. Real FOMO. Accountability issue. 

He suggest:

- Using backtrack to find out the first step toward the goals. And feeling good of working on it. Feeling no guilty to self.  

- Reframe all the "should" with "I choose to"


Was really meaningful. Still need to finish the assignment tho! Be 👺 to myself a little more often.
