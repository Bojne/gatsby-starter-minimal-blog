It's already 5 weeks passed since the beginning of my second year in Minerva. To be honest, I felt like things are moving fast without a good control. At almost the 1/3 of the semester, I truly need some time to stop and think what to commit to. 

What did I spend my time on? 

I did academics and course prepared. I also continues my project at Netlify. I spend time to celebrate firends' birthdays and get around. I read. Truth to be told, I also wasted time in self-double and disorientation, that wasn't a lovely experience. 

So basically, things a typical student encounter. *That make sense.*

But somehow, on top of this - I seek for achieving more. 

My ego says, first of all, I can do better in all of these things: For acdademic, I know I could(and should) do better. I should cultivate a more meaningful time with friends. Be 100% accountable in my work projects, and even proactively try to contribute more.  More time to read(which is really important!). In a best setting: spend less time being upset. 

*Okay. Make sense.*

Yet, there comes more:

    - I started to beleive civic project is great and meaningful

    - Having a undergrad research in a computer science related lab also feels like milestone for me. 

    - Develop a fulfilled life balance in Seoul and actually go out to enjoy yourself. (Hobbies: hiking, photoshot, climbing, volleyball).

    - Hey, also remember summer 2020 internship? It's the job application season in SF, which means lots of coding practice. You also really want to acompolish that. 

    - Something on the end of list: learning web design, continue the projects (https://collager.party, https://inspiration.tw), learn math/econ/physics/design, writing and speaking. 


The list seems impressive, yet too much and unrealistic. 

Then I asked myself: Why do I want so much? Can I say no to something, and be more focused(and convinced myself to do so)? 

To be continue.
